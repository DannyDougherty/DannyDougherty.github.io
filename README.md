I'm a DC-based graphics reporter, focused on data reporting, frontend design and vizualizations--with a touch of mapping, animation and diagramming experience.

# Visually led explainers

I love being in a newsroom, which lets me both collaborate other great storytellers to explain complex news and events, but also lets me do the beat building necessary to write my own dives into big daa (and the occasional fun set of illustrations).

* [In Georgia’s Runoff Election, Midterm Turnout and Blank Ballots Might Reveal Who Has the Edge](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/in-georgias-runoff-election-midterm-turnout-andblankballots-might-reveal-who-has-the-edge-11670092721)

# Ongoing trackers

In addition to deep, narrative dives, years of building technical skills (and learning to concisely summarize the news) has helped me develop a strong cadence for building evergreen trackers that continue to serve readers, while being built on sustainable processes for updating.

# Other graphics stories

Like most folks in a newsroom, I'm not just one thing or another. I'm eager to pitch in on projects ranging from coauthoring breaking stories, to supporting beat reporters' good work to ensuring pieces successfully publish across platforms.

# Tools and libraries

Beyond traditional day-to-day publishing needs, I've helped build several libraries with reusable components to both standardize and streamline workflows.

### Live 3D rendering and animation rig

I built a Three.js-based rig for quickly deploying and easily animating 3D models, balancing access to fine controls with streamlining the familiarity needed with Three to get a project up and running

* [A look at the NASA rocket that could go back to the moon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-inside-look-at-nasas-most-powerful-rocket-ever-the-sls-11661616000)

### Easy sprite animation

This tool was designed to allow illustrators to easily put SVG elements in our interactive template and quickly animate them, using a JSON file to target style attributes via IDs named in Illustrator, cutting out the amount of JS and HTML code needed to get an animated graphic moving

* [How the Federal Reserve works](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/trump-wants-to-upend-the-fed-heres-how-the-central-bank-works-eb0f21fa)
